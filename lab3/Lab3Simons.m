%% Problem 1

% Use the Secant method to find the smallest positive zero of
% f(x) = x^2 |sinx| - 4 accurate to within 10^-6.
problem1();

% There are at 2 values of x such that f(x) = 0.
% When we use p0 = 3.6 and p1 = 3.7, the Secant method computes the
% zero on the interval (3, 4).  When we use p0 = 2.8 and p1 = 2.9,
% the Secant method computes the zero on the interval (2, 3).

%% Problem 2

% Use Newton's method to approximate the zero of the function 
% f(x) = x^2 - 2e^(-x)x + e^(-2x) accurate to within 10^(-8).
